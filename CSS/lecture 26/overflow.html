     <div class="red">The water rush down the wash and into the slot canyon below. Two hikers had started the day to
        sunny weather without a cloud in the sky, but they hadn't thought to check the weather north of the canyon. Huge
        thunderstorms had brought a deluge o rain and produced flash floods heading their way. The two hikers had no
