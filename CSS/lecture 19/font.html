        <p class="lorem">Technology has become an integral part of modern life, influencing how we communicate, learn,
            and work. From smartphones and laptops to artificial intelligence and virtual reality, technological
            advancements continue to shape the way we interact with the world. While these innovations offer countless
            benefits, such as increased efficiency and global connectivity, they also raise important questions about
            privacy, dependency, and ethical responsibility. As technology evolves, it is essential for individuals and
            societies to adapt thoughtfully and responsibly.</p>
